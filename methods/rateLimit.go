// API Rate Limiting:

// Protecting Resources: Limit the number of API requests a client can make to prevent abuse or overloading the server. This is crucial for public APIs to avoid excessive strain on the backend.
// Fair Usage: Ensure that all clients have equal access to the API by preventing any single client from monopolizing resources.
// Preventing Abuse:

// Brute Force Protection: Limit login attempts to prevent brute force attacks on authentication systems.
// Spamming: Prevent users from sending too many messages or making too many requests in a short period to avoid spamming.
// Load Management:

// Resource Constraints: Control the rate of incoming requests or operations to ensure that the system does not become overloaded and can handle the load efficiently.
// Traffic Shaping: Smooth out traffic spikes by limiting the rate of incoming requests to avoid sudden surges that can degrade performance.
// API Consumption Control:

// Usage Plans: Implement rate limits based on subscription plans, allowing different levels of access based on user tiers (e.g., free vs. paid users).
// Quota Management: Track and enforce quotas for different users or applications to ensure fair usage and adherence to service agreements.
